# Policlinic_sqljava

The project represents an application intented to be used in a policlinic chain in order to manage/store all data about pacients, doctors, and each policlinic. The database is meant to be run on a MySQL server and the app is written in java. Reflexion should've definitely been used within this project, though I did not know about it at the time I've written this code..
